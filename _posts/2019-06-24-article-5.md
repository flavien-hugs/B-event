The wall will go up and Mexico will start behaving.
When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.
I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me —and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.
Laziness is a trait in the blacks. ... Black guys counting my money! I hate it.
The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our leaders can't say no!
One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace. Good people don’t go into government.
He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK, I hate to tell you.
